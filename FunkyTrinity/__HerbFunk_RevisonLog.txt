	*Searching for safespots has been once again overhauled:
		*Uses some of my previous safe point finding code.. but most code has been rewritten to support future extensions.
		*GPCircle: Is created with a centering Vector3 and the number of expansions it will encompass. (Surrounding points it will add to itself).

		-Sector can be retrieved from the GPCircle which will contain points relavent to the quadrant it lies in based upon the center.

		*Safe movement method will always evaluate current position GPCircle, followed by potential directional GPCircles.
		*When using Directional GPCircles, a DirectionPoint is created which evaluates a directions maximum range, using raycasts to adjust range accordingly.
